  abstract = {In this paper a linear model-based predictive control (MPC) algorithm
	is presented, for which nominal closed-loop stability is guaranteed.
	The input is obtained by minimizing a quadratic performance index
	over a finite horizon plus an end-point state (EPS) penalty, subject
	to input, state and output constraints, Under certain conditions,
	the weighting matrix in the EPS penalty enables one to specify an
	invariant ellipsoid in which the input, state and output constraints
	are satisfied. In existing MPC algorithms this weighting matrix is
	calculated off-line. The main contribution of this paper is to incorporate
	the calculation of the EPS-weighting matrix into the on-line optimization
	problem of the controller. The main advantage of this approach is
	that a natural and automatic trade-off between feasibility and optimality
	is obtained. This is demonstrated in a simulation example. (C) 2002

	cases: i) directed networks with fixed topology, ii) directed networks
	with
	
	switching topology, and iii) undirected networks with communication
	timedelays
	
	and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks
	
	with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in
	
	all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic
	connectivity
	
	(or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or
	
	negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the
	generalization
	
	of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to
	
	digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing
	
	average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for
	
	convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function
	is a
	
	Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed
	
	a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function
	for
	
	the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology.
	
	A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems

	with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely
	
	on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations
	
	are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical
